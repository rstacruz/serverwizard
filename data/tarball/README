Bootstrap script
================

To bootstrap a remote server from your computer, use:

    ./remote.sh username@server-name

This will connect to the remote server via SSH, upload all the
needed files, and run the bootstrap script.

Alternative usage
-----------------

For servers without SSH access, copy all the files in this
directory to the server and run:

    sudo ./bootstrap.sh
